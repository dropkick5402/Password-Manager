1. Review what is happening with the project
2. Research what other features you want to go in the project
3. Don't rush the features. You definitely will want to be able to explain everything in detail in an interview

Some things we can implement:
1. Password strength Analysis
2. Password expiration
3. Password generator customization - specify length, minimum special, minimum caps, minimum numbers, include caps, lower case or numbers
5. export/import functionality
6. generated password history?
7. instead of a search, see if you can just log in to see all of your passwords in a list.



To improve:

Passphrase generator:
1. open a new window to change parameters:
    a. # of words
    b. customize separator
    c. capitalize/uppercase/lowercase
    d. include number
        - number of numbers?
    e. include special character
        - number of special characters?

Password list:
1. open a new window and display data.json information
